## Xbox Title Update to-do (07/27/23):
### Core
- [x] Try to figure out why locals aren't spawning on Geonosis Spire
- [x] Fix or replace towcables on Geonosis Spire GCW
- [x] Galactic Conquest voices (planet voiceovers)
- [ ] Galactic Conquest AI Fleet-building (no idea if this was a problem with base-game or not, or if it's an emulator problem or actually related to the recompiled shell)
- [x] Rebel Raider challenges (Mygeeto is mostly working, need to repeat the process for the other maps and then fix things up) should be workable, except spa1 which was removed
- [x] spa3_r - Needs TIE spawns lowered some, ship icon for Imperial Venator
- [x] Merge Imperial Enforcer AI improvements in
- [x] replace kam1c_c with new copy of script that removes ingame intro movie call (we're using the transition movie instead); this is fine since it is a singleplayer only mission script, so no worries about desync (fingers crossed)

### Stretch
- [x] Space Kamino Ingame Movie (this will be tough) workaround, placing these movies in shell.mvs and calling them as the transition movies instead works fine
- [x] Cut Objective Mode scripts or find a way to restrict them to only showing up for splitscreen? CUTTING THIS MODE
- [x] Commander Cody on Utapau Order 66 
- [x] Commander Bly Clone Commando on Felucia Order 66
- [x] Order 66 Mygeeto
- [x] Order 66 Kashyyyk
- [ ] Space Mustafar Assault?
- ~~[ ] Challenge Campaigns stats screen(s)?~~

### Localization
- [x] Another Localization Pass,
- [x] think the two Order 66 modes are missing some localization

### Testing
Splitscreen Stability Testing: 
- [x] Challenges, 
- [ ] Subjugation, 
- [x] Order 66, 
- [ ] Reconquest of the Rim, 
- [ ] Galactic Conquest

- [ ] Galactic Conquest Testing (misc)
- [ ] Multiplayer Testing (System Link, Insignia)
